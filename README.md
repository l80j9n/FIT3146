ASSIGNMENT 1   [50%] 
Creation and Technology   Matrix 
Purpose 
The   purpose of this assignment is to   provide a   mark for   the   learning   process   that   students
undertake during the   unit while   providing   maximum flexibility and giving students a   choice   on   areas   of   interest.
Completion of this assignment demonstrates an   understanding of the   learning   outcomes:
● Methodically   locate and   use   new technologies to solve a specific   problem   in   a variety   of   contexts 
●          Use a variety of techniques to   learn   new technologies at   different   levels   of   depth   of   understanding and   be able to communicate this to   others
●          Be able to articulate   how emerging technologies are   used   in   different   contexts   including   social good,   HCI, creativity, and   ethics
Task 
For this assignment, you   must complete 5 different Activities from   the   matrix found   below   through         the creation of artefacts. Across the 5 Activities, you   must   use   and   demonstrate   a   range   of   different   skills. You are allowed to combine   up to 2 Activities   into   1   Artefact,   for   a minimum of 4 Artefacts in total. A minimum of 1 artefact must   make   use of a   microcontroller (see   later   in   the   document for an   example).This assessment is   not only aimed at   the   outcomes   achieved   but   also   the   process   undertaken. This      includes   participation in   undertaking a   range of tasks and demonstrating   a willingness   to   undertake   the   making   process. The student   must   be able to   pitch what they are doing   and   why   to   their
Homeroom   Demonstrator each week during class. The   process will include   some   or   all   of the following:
● Decide on an activity

●          Pitch the idea to your   tutor
●          Plan and make the item (take   selfies   during the   making   process)
● Take a   photo or video   of the   final   build
●          Fill in the matrix with ticks documenting which skills were covered
Pitches will   be   undertaken   regularly during the workshops.   During these   pitches, students can get
their assessment   marked early with feedback   provided.   Up to 2 artefacts   can   be   assessed   per   week.   Students can get their artefacts   remarked in subsequent weeks,   until   the   final   submission   date
allowing them to improve their artefacts   based on the   feedback   given.   Students   are   allowed   to   use   a   range of   materials   provided in class, or external   materials   purchased,   but   any   kits   or
prebuilt/designed   materials will   not   be considered as the student's work and will   not   be   marked.
Students are only marked on their designs and constructions. 
Along with the weekly check-ins, Students   need to   provide a final   portfolio document   containing            evidence of their artefacts. This document   needs to contain   2   images   per   artefact.   1   Image   must         showcase the artefact in its final form, and   the   other   must   be   labelled   showing   all   the   features   the   artefact   has. The document will contain 8-10 images   in total   and   must   be   submitted   to   Moodle   by   the deadline.   In this document, 1 artefact   must   be clearly   labelled   as   the   highlighted   artefact.   This   artefact should   be the artefact that the student   believes to   be their   best work. This   highlighted代 写FIT3146 - Maker Lab ASSIGNMENT 1 Creation and Technology Matrix
代做程序编程语言 artefact can   have its weighting adjusted (up to   50%) to   reflect the   amount   of   effort   applied.   Staff will determine the weighting of this   highlighted artefact, and staff   can   reassign   a   higher weight   to   the   highlighted artefact to   reflect the work   put into its development.   Students   can   discuss this through the weekly check-ins,   but staff   retain the   right to determine the weight. The   remaining   artefacts are evenly weighted for a total of   100%   across   all   artefacts.   E.g.   Highlighted   artefact      weighted at 40% and the other 4   artefacts weighted   at   15%   each.
Template and Expectations 
A template   has   been   provided on   Moodle as a starting   point for the   assignment.   Students   must   fill   out the   Matrix, add   photos of each of their   artefacts,   and   provide   details   on the   features   of   each one.
Students are encouraged to experiment with the creation   of their   artefacts,   and   any   failures   should   also   be discussed with their demonstrator, as this can   be   assessed   under   the   experimentation category of the   marking criteria. Considerations for the target   audience   and the   completeness   of   the artefacts are   also   encouraged. 
There is   no   minimum or   maximum word count for this assessment,   but   only   the   features   of your artefact   need to   be   mentioned. Students   need to   pitch to their   homeroom demonstrators in   class,   and failure to do so can   lead to   marks   not   being   awarded for   areas   unknown   to   the   marker.
Students are encouraged to   use skills outside of   the   matrix   shown   below,   and   any   materials   or technologies   used can   be documented in the   matrix as   required. The   goal   of this   assessment   is   for   students to experiment with different   materials and technologies, to enhance their   skills   ready   for         Assignment 2. 
Students who are struggling with a concept should discuss   ideas with   their   homeroom demonstrator.   Focusing on artefacts that could improve their   lives,   the   lives   of friends   or   family,   or   the   lives of others is   usually   a   good   starting   point. 
At least 1 artefact is   required to   have a   microcontroller within it. This   microcontroller can   be
Ardui   no,   Little   bits,   Makey   Makey,   Raspberry   Pi, or any other form. of   microcontroller. The microcontroller   needs to   be attached to external sensors and cannot   be   just   the   microcontroller   by      itself.   E.g. an Ardui   no that is connected to   an   HC02   Bluetooth   sensor,   some   LEDs   and   an   ultrasonic   distance sensor, that   measures the distance to a car   and   notifies   the   user   of   how   close   their   car   is      to the wall through   Bluetooth to their   phone and   LEDs. The   use of this   microcontroller   should   be   a major   part of the artefact and   have   some   kind of   housing   or   case   to   contain   the   controller   neatly. 
Example Matrix: 
An example of a filled-out   matrix can   be seen   below,   and   a   Matrix will   be   provided within   the   assignment template.
In the   below example, 5 example artefacts   have   been   created for   this   assignment:
1.         An   Ironman Glove
2.       A   Rube   Goldberg   Machine
3.         A Teddy   bear
4.       An   Emergency   Beacon
5.         A   Bark   Boat
